# Project-Mind
[Snapshot] Created a game in a group of 4 for Global Game Jam 2018 at the Unity office in Bellevue, WA. Using that yearâ€™s theme, transmission, we created a game where the player races against the clock to project their consciousness into each creature before the creature dies. I worked as the lead programmer between the 2 programmers, making the final call on code architecture.
